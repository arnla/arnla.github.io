                <h3>WARD</h3>
                <p>WARD, which stands for "Well Assessment and Risk Determination",
                    is an ASP.NET MVC web application created for work.
                    Along with two other developers, I contributed to the development of this application to replace an
                    Excel document which was being used to complete risk assessments of wells.

                            This project was completed with three developers and two business analysts. It involved requirements
                            gathering and coordination with the business analysts. As the lead developer, I worked on the back-end
                            and front-end. This included UI, database integration and migrations.

                            Completed as the final project for a software entrepreneurship course, this Android application
                            allows users to rent tools from their neighbours, as well as rent out their own tools. This
                            product is aimed at homeowners who need tools but do not want to buy their own. It allows
                            allows owners to earn some extra income from tools that may not be in use.
