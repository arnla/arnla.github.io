                Whenever I see people with their headphones on, I always wonder what song they are listening to.
                This net art piece will be designed to allow users to share their music, as well as see what others are listening to nearby. When users
                open the application, they will send their GPS location and the music they are currently listening to. The piece will connect to Spotify
                which will allow users to share their songs or playlists. Once a user's GPS location is sent, they will be able to see what music is being
                listened to by the people that are near them.
            </p>

                The main information that is needed is the user's GPS location, as well as the Spotify song or playlist they are currently listening to.
                This information will remain in the database until the user opens the app again and their location and music are updated. Since the application
                will be connected to Spotify, users will be able to listen to the music that appears.

                To begin, the user will open the application. There will be a button prompting them to see the music around them. Once this button is clicked, 
                the user's GPS location will be sent along with their current music.

                The user's GPS location is then used to find all the other music in the database that it within a certain amount of kilometers. Once this 
                information has been fetched, a window will open displaying all the music that is being listened to nearby.
