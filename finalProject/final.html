        <h1>Final Project</h1>
        
        <p>Since the assignment I enjoyed the most was Assignment 1, the web page, I decided to create an interactive web page for my final project. In the spirit of Christmas
            I created an activity where users can decorate their own Christmas tree. They can drag ornaments from the left side of the screen onto the tree. Once an ornament
            is picked up, a clone is created and can be dropped on the tree canvas. From there, that clone can be picked up again and dragged to a different area. It can also
            be discarded if it it is no longer needed.
        </p>

        <p>To implement this web page, I used javascript and jQuery</p>
