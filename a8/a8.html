                •	Found the furnace room and found a briefcase<br>
                •	Opened the briefcase – it gives me a task to deliver a drink to a man with red hair<br>
                •	I go up the stairs looking for a man with red hair and find him<br>
                •	Delivered the drink to the man with the red hair - he gave me a task to go find the exit<br>
                •	I walk down to the original floor and find the exit<br>
                •	I go through the exit and I am notified that I have completed the contract - it takes me to a new setting<br>
                •	Saw a memo card telling me to go to the furnace room<br>

                <h2>Questions</h2>
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
                <b>1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?</b><br><br>
                The permitted interaction keeps the narrative on track because you are only able to do actions that will help you towards your goal.
                However, it seems that the order that you complete actions in order to complete your task does not matter and is up to the player.
                For example, the second task required me to find five birds and take photos of them. The order in which the birds are found may depend
                on the player and the different branches they take.<br><br>
                <b>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story.</b><br><br>
                The graphics of the game seem to purposely be pixelated, similar to Minecraft. I believe it is relevant to the story because it gives
                the story an air of mystery.<br><br>
                <b>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels.</b><br><br>
                While I was playing the game, I felt very uneasy. The music provided an eerie vibe to the game. Because I felt like something bad was
                going to happen, I found myself choosing the paths/branches that seemed less scary. For example, during the second task that left me in a dark
                hallway on a stormy night, I found myself choosing to go through the doors which seemed less scary first. In addition, the fact that there
                was a very limited number of actions I could take, I often got frustrated because I was stuck and could not figure out what to do next.<br><br>
